## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (for `npx serve`) or Python (for `http.server`)

### Local Development
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the `frontend` directory.
2. Start a local server:
	 - With Node.js:
		 ```
		 npx serve .
		 ```
	 - With Python:
		 ```
		 python -m http.server 8000
		 ```
3. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8000/`.
4. The application will always start at the homepage (`index.html`).

## Usage
